Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software engineers to design, develop, and test software systems. It is a very useful concept in software engineering as it involves the required steps in software engineering. Here are the various phases of the Software Development Life Cylce.
1. Planning: In this phase, project goals, scope, and objectives are defined. Feasibility studies are conducted to assess the project's viability. A project plan and schedule are created.
2. Requirements Analysis: Gathering and analyzing user requirements. Functional and non-functional requirements are documented. Requirements are validated with stakeholders to ensure they align with business objectives.
3. Design: Developing the overall system architecture. Designing system components, modules, and interfaces. Detailed design specifications are created, outlining how the system will be implemented.
4. Implementation (Coding): Writing code based on the design specifications. Developers implement the functionalities outlined in the design phase. Unit testing is conducted to ensure individual components work as expected.
5. Testing: Conducting testing to verify that the software meets specified requirements and quality standards. This includes integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
6. Deployment: Preparing the software for release. Deploying the software to the production environment. Providing training and documentation for end-users.
7. Maintenance: Addressing issues, performing updates, and improving the software over time. This phase may include corrective, adaptive, and perfective maintenance to ensure the software remains effective and up-to-date.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Agile and Waterfall are two popular models for software development, Agile and Waterfall, offer different approaches to managing and executing projects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
Agile Model: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback throughout the development process. Agile divides the project into small, manageable iterations, with each iteration delivering a working product increment.
Waterfall Model: Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It follows a structured progression through phases, with each phase being completed before moving to the next. Requirements are gathered upfront, and the entire project is planned and executed in a sequential manner.
Advantages: Clear project scope and requirements, well-defined phases and deliverables, and easy to manage and understand.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Below are the Key Differences between Agile Waterfall Models of Software Development:
1. Approach:
Agile: Iterative and incremental approach with frequent releases and adaptability to changing requirements.
Waterfall: Sequential and linear approach with distinct phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) that are completed in sequence.

2. Flexibility:
Agile: Emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to change. Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
Waterfall: Less flexible as requirements are defined upfront and changes are difficult to accommodate once the project is underway.

3. Customer Involvement:
Agile: Encourages continuous customer involvement and feedback throughout the development process. Customers have visibility into the progress and can provide input to shape the product.
Waterfall: Limited customer involvement until the later stages of development. Feedback is gathered mainly at the end of each phase, making it challenging to address changes or issues early on.

4. Risk Management:
Agile: Mitigates risks through iterative development, allowing for early identification and resolution of issues. Risks are managed incrementally as the project progresses.
Waterfall: Risks are identified and addressed in the planning phase, with less opportunity for course correction during implementation. Changes late in the project can lead to increased risks.

5. Delivery Time:
Agile: Enables faster delivery of working software increments, with the ability to release features in shorter cycles.
Waterfall: Longer delivery times due to the sequential nature of the process, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
